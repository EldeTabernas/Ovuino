# Material needed for this project

I'll try to show all the material that I'd use during the project and why did I choose that instead of other solutions.

## BOM
 * Electric oven or toaster
 * Solid state relays
 * LCD display
 * Rotary encoder with button
 * Some cables and jumper wires
 * USB charger to power the Arduino
 * Any Arduino board
 
 #### Why?
 
 ##### Electric oven or toaster
   Cheap and easy to get.
 ##### Solid state relays
   Mandatory to use PWM signals on power systems. Mechanical relays are slower and noisier.  
   **Make sure that the ones that you get can get excited by 5V** that's the maximum voltage that the Arduino can handle.
 ##### LCD display
   Easiest way to get data from Arduino in an autonomous project.
 ##### Rotary encoder with button
   Fastest/easiest way to input numerical data and confirm.
 ##### Other materials
   Those things are imperative in any project so they don't need any explanation.
